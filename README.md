<h1>React Frontend Engineer Takehome Project</h1>

<a href="https://frontend-engineer-challenge.netlify.app/">Live Demo</a>

<h3>Description</a>
<div>Fetch the most recent tweets about a specified stock ticker using the StockTwits API</div>

<h3>Tech Stack</h3>
<ul>
<li>CRA</li>
<li>Material UI</li>
<li>Express</li>
<li>Serverless with Netlify Functions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ul>
<li>
 Allow the user to input a US stock symbol or several symbols (eg: AAPL, BABA, BAC, etc…)
</li>
<li>
Pull tweets from StockTwits that mention this symbol (stock symbols usually have a $ before them, like: $AAPL, $BABA, etc…)
</li>
<li>
Display the latest matching tweets. How you display them is up to you.
</li>
<li>
When a new tweet comes in, it should automatically be added without having to refresh the page.
</li>
<li>
The user should be able to later add/remove symbols as well. If a user deletes a symbol, the matching tweets should also disappear.
</li>
<li>
The page has to be responsive.
</li>

<li>
The number of tweets for a given symbol needs to be represented.
</li>
<li>
Pay attention to details and make the user-interface and user-experience the best you possibly can, considering time constraints.
</li>
<li>
Treat it like a real project, so things like code structure, readability, reusability… should be taken into consideration.
</li>
</ul>
